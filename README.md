GMCS or Game Coordinate and Movement System by dorkydanny
Fast TKINTER python module code for those in a rush to make a cool and fun game.

WHAT IT INCLUDES:
*Buttons that move a tkinter object
*Easy to program module
*Fast and easy copy and paste with simple code to make editing it easier.
*Can be adapted into coordiantes, but personally I see it as a movement rather than coordinate system

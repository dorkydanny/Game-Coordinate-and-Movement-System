GMCS or Game Coordinate and Movement System by dorkydanny<br/>
Fast TKINTER python module code for those in a rush to make a cool and fun game.<br/>
<br/>
WHAT IT INCLUDES:<br/>
**Buttons that move a tkinter object<br/> 
Easy to program module<br/>
Fast and easy copy and paste with simple code to make editing it easier.<br/>
Can be adapted into coordiantes, but personally I see it as a movement rather than coordinate system**<br/>
